## ☕ Beyond the Procedural Mindset

After months of intensive C programming, the **Java Piscine** was a week-long pivot into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. This sprint forced me to stop thinking in terms of memory addresses and start thinking in terms of **Objects, Inheritance, and Encapsulation**.

## 🛠️ Technical Milestones

The curriculum covers the core pillars of Java and the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) environment.

### 1. The Four Pillars of OOP
* **Encapsulation:** Learning to hide the internal state of objects using access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) and getters/setters.
* **Inheritance:** Designing hierarchical class structures to reuse code and represent real-world relationships.
* **Polymorphism:** Mastering method overriding and overloading to write flexible, extensible code.
* **Abstraction:** Utilizing `abstract` classes and `interfaces` to define strict contracts for software modules.



### 2. The Java Ecosystem
* **Generics:** Implementing type-safe data structures that work across different object types.
* **Exception Handling:** Using `try-catch-finally` blocks to build resilient software that handles runtime errors gracefully.
* **Collections Framework:** Mastering `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and the `Stream API` for efficient data manipulation.
* **Unit Testing:** Writing **JUnit** tests to validate code logic—a shift from the manual test suites used in the C Piscine.

### 3. Design Patterns & Best Practices
The Piscine introduced me to common architectural patterns:
* **Singleton:** Ensuring a class only has one instance.
* **Factory:** Decoupling object creation from the main logic.
* **Strategy:** Enabling an object's behavior to be selected at runtime.

## 🚩 Rigor in a Managed Language

While Java handles memory for you via the **Garbage Collector**, the technical rigor remained high.
* **Automated Grading:** Submissions were still verified by an automated system that checked for edge cases and performance.
* **Code Quality:** Heavy emphasis on naming conventions (CamelCase), documentation (Javadoc), and the "Single Responsibility Principle."

## 🧠 Why Java Matters to a Systems Engineer

Moving from C to Java taught me the value of **abstraction**. While C gives you control over the hardware, Java gives you control over **architectural complexity**. Mastering Java allowed me to approach large-scale software design with a focus on maintainability and scalability—skills that are essential as I move toward full-stack development.
