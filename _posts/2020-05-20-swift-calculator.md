## 📱 The Origin Story

During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, I found myself with a lot of time and a growing curiosity about how the apps on my phone actually worked. While the world was on pause, I decided to start my journey into programming by teaching myself **Swift**.

### 🛠 Learning Process
Without a formal curriculum, I navigated the basics of mobile development alone:
- **Swift Syntax:** Understanding types, optionals, and basic logic.
- **Interface Builder:** Learning how to design responsive UIs using Auto Layout.
- **Logic Implementation:** Translating mathematical operations into code.

### 💡 Reflection
This project was my first real "Hello World" in software engineering. It taught me the most valuable skill I use today at **EPITA**: the ability to learn a new technology independently from scratch. 

While I now focus on low-level **C** and systems architecture, this calculator remains a reminder of why I started coding—to build tools that work.
