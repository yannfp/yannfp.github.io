## 🏆 Winner of the Regional Prize for Creativity (NSI Trophy)

**Argonimeaux** is a specialized visualization tool for marine animal behavior in Europe, built using **CNES** satellite data. This project was born out of a real-world request from **1st-grade students** at our school who needed a specific way to study local biodiversity.

### 🤝 The Mission: Helping Younger Students
The existing tools were too complex for primary students, so our team of three was tasked with creating a simplified, region-specific interface. We aimed to help them understand how environmental variations and climate change impact the paths of sharks, turtles, and beacons.

### 🛠 The "Hard Work" & Technical Stack
This was our first major group project, and it required intense coordination. 
- **Database Management:** I personally managed the **SQL** architecture, importing years of raw `.txt` files into a searchable database.
- **UI & Visualization:** We used **Tkinter** for the interface and **Folium** to render the actual geographic traces.
- **Coordinate Conversion:** We spent significant effort developing functions to convert pixel-based UI clicks into precise longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates for the database.

### 🚩 The Git Learning Curve
Since this was our first collaborative endeavor, we decided to use **Git** to share our code. However, we were entirely self-taught in version control at the time.
- **The Struggle:** We used Git in a very minimalist, "trial-and-error" way. 
- **The Lesson:** This led to frequent merge conflicts and technical "headaches" during integration. Dealing with these problems manually taught us the absolute necessity of rigorous version control—a lesson that became a pillar of my current workflow at **EPITA**.

### 🌊 Summary
Despite the technical hurdles and the intense workload, we successfully delivered a tool that met the 1st-graders' needs and earned us the **Regional Prize for Creativity**.
